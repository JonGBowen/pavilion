      Welcome  to  the  Connector  game! 
      </br>
      <br>
      This game is played by two human players (you and another person).
      <br><br>
      In each round, you either play as a <em>SPEAKER</em> or as an <em>GUESSER</em>.
      You  are  the  Speaker  in  this  game,  and you will play with a Guesser. You will be shown  two  highlighted  words  on  the board  above,  and  your  task  is  to  come up with a one-word clue that is related to  both  words.  This  clue  should  be informative to the Guesser, so that they can  guess  the  two  words  on  the  board based on the clue
      <br><br>
      The game is repeated a certain number of rounds, and each round roles are randomly assigned.
